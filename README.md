# Cluetring and Unsupervised learning project. 

### Dataset
The dataset was taken from kaggle.
1. Wine Quality: https://www.kaggle.com/ajaysingh123/wine-quality-clustering-unsupervised

#### Mtedology Followed:
1. visualized the distribution of all features.
2. Created plots to visualize the data using PCA (top two principal components) and discussed about diamentionality reduction.
3. Created plots to visualize the data using t-SNE and discussed about parameter tuning.
4. Used different clustering algorithms were used for the model building. 
   1. K-Means 
   2. DBSCAN
   3. Agglomerative clustering
   4. Gaussian Mixture
